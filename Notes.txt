General Notes:
-no logs and not much in error handling
-tested with windows, filepaths may not work with linux / OSX
-most entryboxes may be empty, without a savename value, the file will not be saved 

Load x y data listbox:
-only one x data file can be loaded
-multiple y data files can be loaded
-cannot plot multiple axis 
-may not work with linux / OSX

Choose Colour: 
-check 'Use choose colour' to enable
-if not enabled, default matplotlib colors are used
-if enabled and no colors are chosen, black '#000000' will be used
-works with y data listbox, does not work with data input
-select a data file in y data listbox to choose a color
-works with scatter

Input Data:
-check 'input Data' checkbutton to enable this
-use either load or input.  They do not work at the same time.  If 'input Data' is checked, load files will be ignored
-enter list seperated by a combination of commas, line breaks, or spaces
-does not work with colour chooser

Title, X label, Y label, Legend
-enter string as string
-does not work with latex if commands require the backslash '\'
-uses default matplotlib font and size and color
-enter legend as comma seperated string

xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax
-numeric value only, must fulfill xmin < xmax and ymin < ymax

width, height
-width and height in inches
-must be positive numeric values

Save as
-if left blank, graph will not be saved
-must include the file extension(i.e. to save as a.jpg, enter 'a.jpg')

Line, Scatter
-choose one
-colour works with both, but linestyle obviously only works with line
-line does not have markers
-scatter uses matplotlib 'o' marker

x axis log, y axis log
-if none are checked, uses default plot
-if x axis log is checked, y axis log unchecked => uses semilogx
-if x axis log unchecked, y axis log is checked => uses semilogy
-if both are checked => loglog
-can work with either scatter or line

trendlines
-if shown, uses the '--' linestyle
-line and equation uses default matplotlib color

get all
-creates graph
-graph will only save if save as entry is filled
-graph will appear regardless if saved or not
